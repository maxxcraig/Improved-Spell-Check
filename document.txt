It was a truely amazing day. The sky was clear, and the whether felt just right. I couldnt beleive how peaceful everything was. Youre going to love it here, she said, smiling with confindence. We walked along the beach, wich was almost empty, except for a few people sunbathing and reading books.

As we sat down on the sand, I opened my backpak and pulled out the sanwiches. She had made them herself, and they were deliciuos. I asked her how she learnt to cook so well, and she said it was her mom who taught her, but she also just payed close attention to the details.

We talked for hourrs about everything: childhood memories, our goals, even embarassing stories from school. One time I got so nervus before a class presentation that I droped all my notecards. She laughed, saying she once wrote an entier essay on the wrong topic.

Later, we walked over to a restarant nearby. It was small and cozy, with candles on each tabel and soft music playing. The waiter was freindly, and the menu looked good. I ordred the lasagna, and she chose the salmon. While we waited, we chatted more about our familys and jobs. She told me about her trip to Italy, where she had visited multiple historic castels.

I was impressed by how much she had traveld. I've always wanted to go overseas, but the oppertunities never seemed to come at the right time. Still, I hoped that someday soon I’d have the chance to explore more of the world.

After dinner, we headed back toward the beach, wich by now was lit only by the moonlight. It was absolutly beautiful. We sat quietly, listening to the sound of the waves, and she said it felt like a movie scene. I agreed, feeling content and reasured.

The next morning, we got up erly and hiked through the nearby forest. The trail was muddy from the rain the night before, but that didnt stop us. We past several other hikers and a few runners. The air was crisp, and birds chirpped above us.

At the top of the hill, we stoped to rest. The view was breathtaking. You could see for miles, all the way to the vally on the other side. She pointed out a herd of deer in the distanse. I almost missed them at first, but then saw the white tails flicking.

We took some pictres and talked about the next place wed visit together. Maybe the mountains, or a desert roadtrip. There were so many possibilites. I was excited just thinking about it.

Back at the cabin, I checked my email and saw a message from my boss. It wasnt urgent, but he wanted an update on the projct. I typed a quick reply and shut my laptop. No need to ruin the weekend vibe.

We played a boardgame later that afternoon. I usualy win, but this time she beat me fair and square. I joked about a rematch, and she just smiled and said “next time.” We both laughed.

At sunset, we went out again. The clouds turned pink and orange, and the waves crashed in rhythm. It felt like time had slowed down. I told her I’d never forget this trip, and she said the same.

On the drive home, we listned to music and shared our favorite songs. She played one that reminded me of highschool days, back when things were simpler. I felt a wave of nostalga and told her a story about skipping class to go to the arcade.

We stopped for coffee and gas, and while I was waiting for the drink, I noticed a couple arguing about their order. It was a silly miscommunication, but it made me think about how important it is to talk clearly.

Back on the road, we drove in silnce for a while. It was a comfortable silence. The kind you only share with someone you trust. I glanced over and saw her looking out the window, smiling to herself.

I thought about all the things that had led us here. The missed chances, the right decisions, the late-night texts. Life has a funny way of working out. Sometimes, the most unexpexted things bring the most joy.

We got back late, and she hugged me goodbye. I promised to call her tommorow and we parted ways. It had been the perfect weekend.

Looking back, I realize how lucky I am to have moments like these. They make all the stress and chaos of daily life feel worth it.

Im learning to appriciate the little things more — a good conversation, a homecooked meal, a long walk with someone you care about.

This trip reminded me that time is short, and memories are priceless.

I think we all need to slow down once in a while and just be present. Put down the phone, take a deep breath, and soak it all in.

So thats what I’m doing now — just being here. And it feels good.
